     * Hello Chris or Peter
     * 
     * if you are one of the lucky people to download our game, and you decide to decomplie
     * our work we'd appreciate if you don't redistribute it. Furthermore if you do decide
     * to use it for yourself just read through the comments 
     * 
     * Anyways
     * 
     * Here are some rules we should stick by while coding
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * If your declaring a Variable make it short but meaningful. Begin the decalration with a lowercase letter
     * 
     * If you declare a Constant use all Captial Leters and seperate internal words with an underscore
     * 
     * For a Class use a noun that communicates letters and seperate words with an _ (start with uppercase)
     * 
     * For a method use a  multiword name that vegins with a verb in lowercase that communicates what the method does 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     *
