-I added some for loops into our floormaker script in order to try to make the code generate barriers relative to the dimensions we decide to use

-Furthermore, I used two  new commands from c# in order to disregard the compilers warnings about using unreachable code

Thanks Chris! Will do.

Drunkard walk algorithm is perfect and works flawlessly. Next step is to create character within grounds and add a bullet sprite as well.

Added Primitave bullet script(Currently Functioning), all I need to do now is make the gun sprite aim where my cursor
is pointing at via player script. In the future we should add a bullet counter, and UI to let player know how many bullets are remaining. More work has to be done on creating a switch statment to cycle through guns
