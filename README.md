-I added some for loops into our floormaker script in order to try to make the code generate barriers relative to the dimensions we decide to use

-Furthermore, I used two  new commands from c# in order to disregard the compilers warnings about using unreachable code






-PS. I really hate layers. I promise you Peter I will never use them.

PS. I wish would of taken Chris' advice about the godlike option of creating layers. Now I have forever ruined the way he 
looks at them. I should punish myself..
